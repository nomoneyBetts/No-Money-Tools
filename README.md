# No Money Tools 
No Money Tools is a collection of independent systems designed to aid the development process. The goal of each system is to solve a single problem common to the world of game dev. Therefore, you can easily integrate our tools into your projects by importing what you need and leaving out the rest - just make sure to import _Root!

You can find documentation at [nomoneystudios.com/tools](https://nomoneystudios.com/tools)
